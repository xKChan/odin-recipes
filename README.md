# odin-recipes
The project was all about creating a website to link my three favorite recipes to. Overall it was a fun experience trying to play around with HTML and being able to start making a website.

I was able to use the main html skills to make the building blocks of the websites.  I am looking forward to learning css and js to make this website even better.
